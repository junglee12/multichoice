## Quiz File Format

The application expects your quiz data in a CSV or Excel file with a specific structure based on column position. The **first row is assumed to be headers and is ignored**; data parsing begins from the second row.

*   **Column 1 (Index 0):** Question Text
*   **Column 2 (Index 1):** Option A Text
*   **Column 3 (Index 2):** Option B Text
*   **Column 4 (Index 3):** Option C Text
*   **Column 5 (Index 4):** Option D Text
*   **Column 6 (Index 5):** Correct Answer Letter (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D').
    *   The letter should correspond to one of the options.
    *   Leading/trailing single or double quotation marks around the letter (e.g., `"A"` or `'B'`) are automatically removed.

*Any columns beyond the 6th will be ignored.*

**Example (CSV format):**
```csv
